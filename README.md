# Basic_Restaurant_landing_page
For this project, I built a basic restaurant landing page.
The website asks the user for certain information.
Based on the input from the customer, the website registers the order and at the end it tells the user what has been ordered.

Tecknologies used: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
